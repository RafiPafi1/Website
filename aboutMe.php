                    Rzesz√≥w, where
                    I spent 16 years of my life. In the summer of 2016 my family finally got a visa after a long waiting
                    for it and was able to come into the United States. In the United States, I was able to take a look
                    at a new life, which was being in my first programming class back in my high school.
